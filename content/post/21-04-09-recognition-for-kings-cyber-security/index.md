King’s MSc programme in Cyber Security has been recognised by the [Government National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/more-university-degrees-certified). 

NCSC certifies programmes that meet agreed standards in cyber security. Certification demonstrates high quality and relevance of the degree curriculum and learning and can boost the employability of graduates.

King’s has established excellence in cyber security. The Cyber Security MSc is run in the Department of Informatics. The department has a vibrant Cybersecurity group which studies design, modelling, analysis, verification and testing of networks and systems in order to tackle cyber security and privacy problems that are important to industry, society and everyone living in a technologically dependent world.

Commenting on the certification, programme leader Dr Fabio Pierazzi said:
> It is really a great achievement and honour to receive this prestigious recognition. NSCS certification demonstrates the high-quality and relevance of the MSc in Cyber Security we offer within our curriculum, and its impact in terms of learning and employability of our graduates. It reflects a great collective effort by a lot of people, including (but not limited to) all staff members of the Cybersecurity Group (CYS), all the people designing and teaching the programme, and – last but not least – all professional services and academic members that helped and supported the application process.“

Chris Ensor, NCSC Deputy Director for Cyber Growth, said:
> “I am delighted that King's College London's Cyber Security MSc is now certified by the NCSC. Offering a certified degree helps prospective students make more informed choices about their future career prospects in cyber security and employers can rest assured that graduates will be well-taught and have valued industry skills.”
